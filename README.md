some code samples from shipping interface

most of the code is still being used and is therefore redacted, especially most of the back end (/en/controllers and /models/). More JS scripts are included because they are publicly accessible

each controller usually corresponds to one webpage, or several that serve similar functions. the "a_" methods are intended to be used by API calls
